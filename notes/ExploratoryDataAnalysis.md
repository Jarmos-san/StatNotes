# Exploratory Data Analysis

- EDA is an approach/philosophy for data analysis employing a variety of techniques, mostly graphical & quantitative to achieve the following outcomes:
  - Maximise insights into a data set.
  - Uncover underlying structure of the data set.
  - Extract important variables, for say, feature engineering.
  - Detect outliers.
  - Test underlying assumptions.
  - Develop parsimonious models.
- Philosophically, EDA isn't identical to statistical analysis rather its an approach to dissect the data set enough to postpone the initial assumptions and let the data set reveal more information by itself.
- Popular graphical techniques used in EDA are: 
  1. Plotting the raw data using *histograms*, *probability plots*, *block plots*, etc
  2. Plotting simple statiscal graphs like *mean plots*, *standard deviation plots*, *box plots*, etc and the effects on the raw data.
  3. Positioning such plots in such a way that our natural pattern-recognition perceptions can gain as much information easily & quickly.
- A good EDA workflow would be as follows:
  - Check the shape and the data types of the data set.
  - Taking a comprehensive look at the Statistical description of the dataset.
  - Investigating the Target/Dependent variable by looking at unique values and the count.
  - Checking the correlation among variables, preferably through a graph.
  - Using a box plot to take a look at the outliers.
  - Checking the linearity and if the distributions are normal or not is considered a good practice.
