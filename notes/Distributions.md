# Distributions

- Its important to ask four basic questions before proceeding with fitting the data
  - Whether data is discrete and continuous
  - Symmetry of the data to check for outlier and their likeliness.
  - Check the upper and/or lower limits of the data.
  - How likely is it to observer extreme values in the distribution.
- Some popular types of distributions:-
  - **Binomial Distribution**: The Binomial Distribution measures the probabilities of the number of successes over a given number of trials with a specified probability of each trial.

  - **Poisson Distribution**: The Poisson Distribution measures the likelihood of the number of occurances within a given time interval where the key parameter required is the average number of events in the given interval. The resulting image looks like that of a Binomial Distribution but with the skewness being positive but decreasing with 1.

  - **Discrete Uniform Distribution**: Simplest distribution when all of the outcomes have equal probability of occuring.
