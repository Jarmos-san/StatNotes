# Distributions

- Its important to ask four basic questions before proceeding with fitting the data
  - Whether data is discrete and continuous
  - Symmetry of the data to check for outlier and their likeliness.
  - Check the upper and/or lower limits of the data.
  - How likely is it to observer extreme values in the distribution.
- Some popular types of distributions:-
  - **Binomial Distribution**: The Binomial Distribution measures the probabilities of the number of successes over a given number of trials with a specified probability of each trial.
