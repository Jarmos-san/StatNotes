Teaching a concept to oneself is difficult, especially considering the abundance of learning resources out there, it can become quite overwhelming for an individual to pick up a certain concept. Hence, I created this project to take notes using simple Markdown files.

Besides, it should be noted that this project is specifically meant for reference and picking up quick information & shouldn't be considered as a full-fletched learning resource.
